Solutions to Over the Wire Wargames: Bandit
## What is this?
These are my solution scripts to the [OverTheWire Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) CTF games
## How do they work?
These shell scripts are numbered by level

Run it and see the level password and then the prompt for the level password

The script will solve the level and output the password to the next level
